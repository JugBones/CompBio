# Computational Biology Project - Research Study of Phylogenetic Treeâ€™s Construction for Wildlife Conservation

- Team Member: Christopher Alexander Tjiandra, Arvin Yuwono, and Christopher Owen

## Overview
This project aims to address the challenges researchers face in understanding phylogenetic analysis using traditional methods, particularly the complexity of visualizing and analyzing phylogenetic trees. 
These traditional approaches often involve intricate algorithms and massive datasets, making them difficult for researchers and students to interpret. To overcome these obstacles, this project leverages Python programming to simplify the visualization and analysis of phylogenetic trees. 
By using Python's robust libraries and tools, we streamline the process of acquiring, preparing, and analyzing phylogenetic data, such as DNA sequences, from credible sources like NCBI. Our solution includes implementing beginner-friendly algorithms like Neighbor-Joining and UPGMA, chosen for their computational efficiency, scalability, and flexibility. 
This approach provides researchers and students with an accessible and efficient way to study evolutionary relationships, fostering better communication, enhanced research, and deeper insights into phylogenetics.

### Key Features
- Simple GUI using Tkinter library, the GUI here is in a form of popup window. In the GUI, It has function for uploading the fasta files and download the combined files.
- Visualizations for the Phylogenetic Tree, using matplotlib library.
- Time and Space complexity features.
